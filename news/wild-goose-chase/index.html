				<p>Yesterday I planned a 60-70 mile round trip over to Wigan to see my Brother and his family. The route is fastest via motorway but obviously, being on bicycle, I would need to find alternate routes. I couldn&#8217;t foresee any problems, especially with my <a href="../garmin-edge-1000/index.html">trusty Garmin that I blogged about last week</a>! How wrong was I!</p>
<p>The ride over to Wigan presented no real issues other than traffic lights! If you thought traffic lights were annoying in a car then they&#8217;re 10 times worse on a bike, especially uphill as it&#8217;s hard to get your foot into the pedal. I cycled the 36 miles from Macclesfield to Hindley with a respectable 16.5mph average (considering I was going very steady). My chicken legs felt wonderful and it&#8217;s apparent that <a href="../chicken-legs/index.html">my weight training is paying off</a>!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some photos of my team members (niece and nephew) Paddy the Sprinter and Lyla the domestique.</p>

<p>I stayed at my brother&#8217;s house for around an hour, refueled with some beans on toast and set off on an alternate route home.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>noun</i><br />
noun: <b>wild goose chase</b>; plural noun: <b>wild goose chases</b><br />
a foolish and hopeless pursuit of something unattainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should have known from the start that I can&#8217;t always trust the Garmin, as it sent me in a direction that I knew was opposite to where I should be going. However I&#8217;m not familiar with the roads around there and presumed it would take me to an alternate route in order to avoid the motorways.</p>
<p>After around 30 minutes of unfamiliar roads I found myself back at the start of my brother&#8217;s town. I had looped 5-10 miles around instead of just cycling 2 miles through it.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t really fazed by this as it was lovely day and I was really enjoying my cycling. It was around 2pm and I was looking forward to the ride home and having some spare time to go food shopping before the rugby starts at 6pm.</p>
<p>Two hours later and I was lost. I had placed far too much faith in my Garmin. Not only did I not have a clue where I was, but it seemed my Garmin didn&#8217;t either. It was constantly trying to navigate me onto <strong>&#8220;cyclepaths&#8221;</strong> which were mainly alleyways full of litter and broken glass or canal routes littered with stones and no tarmac. I tried to navigate out of this huge industrial estate multiple times but in my confusion I kept ending up at these bloody <strong>&#8220;cyclepaths&#8221;</strong>. At one point I was riding a canal route and I was very close to falling into the water as I skidded on the pebbles. I also crossed an encolsed tram line which led to a dead-end grass area meaning I had to do a u turn, much to the enjoyment of those waiting for the tram watching a cyclist in full kit so badly lost. I looked a right plonker. I&#8217;m laughing about it now but I certainly wasn&#8217;t at the time, I was livid.</p>
<p>I looked down at my stats and I had done 65 miles. I was down to my last energy gel and it was getting late. The streets were now littered with rugby fans attending the rugby match I was supposed to be watching in a few hours (I actually passed the stadium which, by about 4-30pm, was absolutely packed with fans). I decided to ignore the navigation and just try to find my own way home. I knew the names of some towns but I didn&#8217;t know the roads I needed to follow. I needed to find Wythenshawe/Manchester Airport as I knew the way from there. I tried the Garmin one last time on automobile mode, but set to avoid motorways in the hope of avoiding these dreaded <strong>&#8220;cyclepaths&#8221;</strong>. You can probably guess what happened next? Directed me straight towards the motorway! Switched back to bike mode and it sends me to an underground bypass which looked like a crack den.<br />
I was absolutely fuming, felt so helpless and was close to crying. My ass was bleeding with saddle-sores, I was hungry and thirsty and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; I was going to miss the rugby.</p>
<p>One hour later I had found Wythenshawe and luckily I was back on familiar roads. I was around 11 miles from home and I felt surprisingly good. I had completed 86 miles and I knew I was going to be very close to a century ( I had far surpassed the <a href="../11-months-to-go/index.html">80 mile target I set myself this month</a>).</p>
<p>I have both <a href="http://shaneprendergast.co.uk/personal/hitting-the-wall/" target="_blank">&#8220;hit the wall&#8221;</a> and also ended up in hospital with dehydration previously and they&#8217;re not nice feelings. I was around 8 miles from home and all of a sudden I felt dangerously low on energy levels. I started to become disorientated and, although my legs didn&#8217;t feel massively tired, I was struggling to get them moving. I&#8217;d had no food or water in over 2 hours and I knew I was in a bad place.<br />
I had to get off the bike and sit down for a few minutes while I regained my composure. I was literally 3 flat miles from home and then I could roll the last mile downhill to my house.<br />
The best thing about this situation was experiencing it before. I didn&#8217;t panic and I just focused on the protein milkshakes which would soon be flowing into my body. Although I don&#8217;t remember much of it, I was impressed with my determination to get home.</p>
<p>When I finally got into the house I immediately ate some fruit and washed it down with a few protein milkshakes (things taste so good when you&#8217;re that hungry and thirsty). I was a little bit delirious and it took around 40 mins for me to come around. It was 7pm, the match was on the halftime break and I had left the house some 9 hours and 98 miles earlier. If I hadn&#8217;t eaten a decent meal at my brothers I would have been in a serious predicament.</p>
<p>This ride taught me a few things</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan routes beforehand and download to the device to ensure there are no cyclepaths or dodgy routes</li>
<li>Do not rely on Garmin 100%, have a backup plan</li>
<li>Always eat before feeling hungry and ensure I have spare food</li>
<li>Take money on all rides</li>
<li>Get some cream to prevent sore ass</li>
<li>I can do 100 miles! 🙂</li>
</ul>
