				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish I was referring to turning 18 years of age, unfortunatly I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m referring to breaking 18mph average speed on a bike ride.</p>
<p>I mentioned previously how I&#8217;m not concentrating on speeds and averages as such, I&#8217;m just aiming to complete the distances feeling good. However this weekend I broke 18mph average, something I have&#8217;t done previously over any distance (except a 5mile sprint).</p>
<p>If I had to calculate my cycling effort as a percentage I would say I generally ride at around 60-70%. If I&#8217;m on a steady spin I will ride at around 40-50% and a real effort would push me up to 80-90%, I can reach 100% but I would blow up shortly after.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been purposely cycling lots of hilly routes to help build my legs. On my weekend rides I have generally been riding 3000-4000ft elevation over 3-4 hours.<br />
Initially these rides were killers, I was reaching 90% effort levels in the last 1000ft and I was very, very close to blowing up &#8211; and needing to stop &#8211; a few times. My legs felt like lead and I had barely had any strength or energy left.<br />
Since I&#8217;ve become a little bit stronger I&#8217;ve noticed I&#8217;m able to sit on my saddle for longer periods, especially uphill. This has resulted in a noticeable difference in my effort levels. I&#8217;m able to cycle further and faster with a lower % effort. Off course I&#8217;m a long long way off reaching the desired levels, but I&#8217;ve only been training properly for three weeks and this week, for the first time, I have felt a small (my first) reward of training hard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been having issues with my lower back (more on that in a future post) so on Saturday I decided to do a flatish (1200ft elevation) 40 miler. The weather was good, the wind was gentle and my legs felt great after a day of rest. Because of my back I was riding lower than usual &#8211; so my back was almost vertical &#8211; as it was relieving the pressure on it. Being in this position meant I was much more aerodynamic and although I wasn&#8217;t paying much attention to my computer, I knew I was riding pretty fast.<br />
 I checked my average speed at around 25-20 miles and it was 18.5mph. I knew I had a few slight climbs to get back into my hometown (Macclesfield) but I also knew I was feeling much stronger than any previous outing over this distance. I decided to dig deep and try achieve an 18mph average, something I hadn&#8217;t done before.</p>

<p>I pushed hard over the last ten miles, moving up and over my normal effort levels to around 80%. I was riding slightly uphill, into a light headwind and I could feel my energy levels dropping much faster with the increased effort.<br />
It&#8217;s a really weird feeling, my legs start turning slower and mentally they&#8217;re screaming at my brain to slow down. My gear changes become more erratic, constantly dropping gears and turning faster, building my speed back over the 18+ mark and when my legs get a bit of rest from the lower gears I change to a higher one and repeat the process. I must admit I really love the feeling of my legs muscles crying for a rest and pushing myself to limits I haven&#8217;t experienced before.</p>
<p>I reached the top of my street and it&#8217;s all downhill for around half a mile. I checked my speedo (which read 18.2mph average), punched the air in delight and then descended home at speed to make it 18.3mph average. When I got off the bike I felt more wobbly than normal, I still had something in the tank but I could feel I had pushed hard.</p>
<p>This week I signed up with a trainer, so hopefully my training methods are going to improve as I&#8217;m feeling a bit confused about the best way to approach my training for the ride. As I get better I&#8217;m sure my average will improve but this weekend has taught me I shouldn&#8217;t look to exceed those 60-70% effort levels on the ride as, with so many miles to do, it could leave me in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>Oh and I&#8217;m 29 years old if you wondered!</p>
