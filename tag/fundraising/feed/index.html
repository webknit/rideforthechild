				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pleased to say that I will be holding the last &#8211; and biggest &#8211; fundraising event in my hometown Scarborough on the 27th August. It will be hosted by <a href="http://stepneyhillfarm.co.uk/">Stepney Hill Farm</a> in their impressive barn.</p>
<p>This date is only two days before I fly to America so in addition to raising lots of money for the charities, it&#8217;s also an opportunity for my close family and friends to say their goodbyes should I perish whilst trying to ride America.</p>
<p>Invites will be going out closer to the date but almost anyone who wants to support this cause is more than welcome. The itinerary will be confirmed at a later date (there are some good ideas flying about), but a good day/night is guaranteed!</p>
<p>One of the fundraising ideas at this party is a raffle. I am actively contacting businesses in the hope of them donating a prizes towards the raffle. If you could potentially donate something, or know someone else who might be interested, then please shoot me an email on contact@rideforthechild.co.uk.</p>
