				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>This post is a personal version of <a href="https://www.evanscycles.com/coffeestop/news/ride-for-the-child-shane-prendergast/">my article which featured on the Evans website.</a></strong></p>
<p>Since starting this process I&#8217;ve contacted loads of different cycling businesses and organisations to try obtain whatever help I can for my ride. You generally find that, with so many requests for help, most politely refuse. It&#8217;s all about getting in touch with the right people and that&#8217;s something that happened when i spoke to Magdalena (Mags) from <a href="https://www.evanscycles.com/">Evans cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Having already contacted &#8211; and been refused by &#8211; Evans Cycles multiple times, I was delighted when Mags sent me a message saying how she might be able to help. I originally asked for a maintenance course, but she was also kind enough to sort me a bike fit out too, something that I needed since getting a new bike.</p>
<p>I need to say a massive thanks to Evans Cycles and especially Mags, she has been one of the most helpful people from any business since I started 8 months ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Bike Fit</h2>
<p>I had already had a bike fit when I first started training on my first bike. It&#8217;s basically to ensure that your body is correctly positioned on the bike to prevent injury and also to increase performance.</p>

<p>Having <a href="http://rideforthechild.co.uk/news/bad-back/">gone through various injuries</a>, especially with my back, I can&#8217;t emphasise how important a good bike fit is. If you&#8217;re riding an hour or two you might not notice, but when you start doing 4, 5 or 8 hours you will really feel the effects of a bad bike fit.</p>
<p>I already knew what to expect but nethertheless I was excited about getting my new bike perfected, I had been having a few slight aches at 6+ hours in my shoulder and I was interested to hear if I could squeeze any more power out with a new position.</p>
<p>My bike-fitter was Hannah, she was a really nice girl and after telling her all about my ride she also told me about her cycling life and it was clear that she was very passionate about it. We started by videoing me with my current set-up and Hannah re-played it to me in slow motion, highlighting various issues along the way. I knew that my bike wasn&#8217;t going to be too far out as I have been tweaking it for a few months, the main things were the saddle height and handlebar position. After adjusting these I jumped back on the bike and had another look at the slow motion video. Whilst you don&#8217;t magically feel better on the bike &#8211; as obviously you have to try it on the road &#8211; you do feel the difference in position immediately. Like anything it might feel a little awkward at first, but having trusted many &#8216;cycle people&#8217; in the last 8 months, I have never been let down.</p>
<p>I should also add that Hannah had a look at my cleat positioning &#8211; slightly to my embarrassment as my shoes stank, she said she was used to it &#8211; and also answered dozens of my novice questions, she was very helpful indeed. After saying my goodbyes I set out on a 100 mile hilly route which includes one of the biggest climbs in the areas, Winnats Pass.</p>

<p>After a few hours I could really feel a noticeable difference in the amount of power I was applying to the pedals. I definitely felt stronger on a seated climb and I noticed I was staying in the saddle for longer on the steeper sections. I was also pushing a fast-than-normal average speed on the flats.</p>
<p>I completed the ride with a decent average and feeling good, there was also less aching in my shoulders. I can&#8217;t really ask for more than that, the two things I wanted, I got! Thanks to Deansgate Evans Cycles and Hannah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The maintenance course</h2>
<p>This is something I have been thinking about for a while. I have been quite lucky with bike issues as both my bikes have been brand new. However when problems do arise it&#8217;s incredibly frustrating as, although they seem simple to fix, things can quite quickly go wrong! I remember I tried to sort my gearing on my first bike and before I knew it I had completely Fu*&amp;%d it, I had to take it into the shop. Obviously in America I need to know how to fix things when they go wrong, I don&#8217;t think there are many Evans Cycles shops on the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>For my class I went to Macclesfield Evans to meet the manager of the store, Ted. He had shut the shop and stayed late just for me, it was very kind of him. He asked about my ride and basically said he would show me whatever I wanted to know.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t after a degree in bike maintenance, but just wanted to know enough to help me get by in America (I also videoed the whole session, thanks Jordan, so that I can refer back should I need to). The main things were chains, spokes, cables and gears. Ted was a great teacher and he went though each component explaining what is likely to go wrong, how I might prevent it and, most importantly, how to fix it.</p>
<p>Bike maintenance is one of those things that is quite straightforward, but only when you know the basics. Everyone knows they&#8217;re run via cables, chains and gears but until you understand a bit more about how they function, they seem quite daunting to fix.</p>
<p>Ted made things look really easy and I imagine it will take some practice to repair things as smoothly as he did &#8211; I should probably add that i went home and spent two hours getting tyres on my new wheels &#8211; but I left the session feeling a much more complete cyclist, I definitely feel more confident about fixing things.</p>
<p>In addition to showing me everything Ted was also great at answering any questions I might have and he me gave solid concise answers. Thanks a lot to Macclesfield Evans and the very resourceful Ted!</p>
<p>Leaving the maintenance session I really started to feel how close the ride is approaching. There are only ten weeks left and I&#8217;m really starting to feel the pressure both on and off the road. Thankfully there are businesses, organisations and lovely people helping me out before I go and Evans Cycles and their staff are amongst those!</p>
<p>Thanks very much Evans Cycles, especially Hannah, Ted and Mags!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week my friend started road cycling and he asked me what essentials he needed. My initial thoughts were &#8220;not much really&#8221;, but as I started to list the essentials they became more and more extensive. It begged the question &#8211; what do we actually <strong>NEED</strong> as opposed to just want.</p>
<p>In this post I&#8217;m going to outline the items which are essential and other stuff that is optional but makes things easier/more fun/better/convenient.</p>
<p>Obviously the reasons for starting cycling will vary massively so I&#8217;m writing about a typical road cyclist who might do multiple hour rides, not just someone who wants a ride to the local shop for the milk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The essentials</h2>
<p><strong>A bike</strong> &#8211; It goes without saying you need a bike. Generally speaking the more you pay the better the bike. You can get a decent bike for £400-500 and you will be able to ride it fine but it probably won&#8217;t look as good, or be as lightweight as a more expensive bike. Carbon bikes are generally £1000+ and they&#8217;re significantly lighter than an aluminum or steel one. You might ask it&#8217;s only a bit heavier, does it matter? Well, like everything it depends on your requirements, but from my experience I would much rather ride a carbon bike uphill (or anywhere for that matter) than a steel one. With regards to the other components I could go on forever but I will say (generally speaking again) the more expensive the item the better/nicer/smoother/easier/faster it will be to ride.</p>
<p><strong>A helmet</strong> &#8211; Massively important piece of kit that could well save your life. Don&#8217;t go out without a helmet regardless of how annoying or silly it looks.</p>
<p><strong>Lycra Shorts</strong> &#8211; When I first got my bike I went out in some normal football shorts and it ripped my bits and bum to shreds. Lycra is renowned for being breathable with moisture wicking properties and offering a comfortable tight fit. In addition they have pads, known as a chamois, which gives you a little comfort in the saddle. Trust me a four hour numb bum is not pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Lycra top</strong> &#8211; This gives you the ability to wick sweat away from the skin, meaning you won&#8217;t smell as much. If you wear a cotton T-shirt it&#8217;s just going to totally stick to &#8211; and irritate &#8211; your skin. They&#8217;re comfortable and don&#8217;t flap about when you&#8217;re cruising at 40mph downhill. Another plus are the pockets, if you&#8217;ve swapped your jeans for lycra shorts then you&#8217;re pocketless!</p>
<p><strong>Pedals, cleats and shoes</strong> &#8211; Been thinking hard about this one, does one really need to be fixed to their bike? I think if you want to cycle properly then yes you do. Why? Well to me they feel safer, I&#8217;m fixed to my bike and my feet aren&#8217;t going to come flying off when I hit a bump. You pull up as well as push down each time you pedal, it makes a massive difference. They&#8217;re also made to go round and round thousands of times, potential problems could arise from flat pedals or fact you&#8217;re peddling in your trainers. Bad parts include they take some getting used to (I have fallen off a few times, mainly at traffic lights) and they&#8217;re awkward to walk in when off the bike.</p>
<p><strong>Gloves</strong> &#8211; Again it&#8217;s tricky, are these really needed? They prevent friction between your hands and handlebars, prevents blisters and such. In addition, they dampen the vibrations which causes the hands to numb. However the biggest reason for me is to keep my hands warm. Admittedly I am a weak man with cold hands &#8211; once they&#8217;re cold I can&#8217;t ride well.</p>
<p><strong>Jacket</strong> &#8211; Unless you&#8217;re cold blooded I would highly recommend a jacket. Whilst it might feel/look quite warm out, once you&#8217;re riding into constant wind things can quickly change. Add some rain and descents to the mix and it&#8217;s freezing. A windproof and waterproof jacket is essential for me. If I get my lycra top wet then I&#8217;ve had it, I will never get warm again. The worst is being wet and the wind blowing hard, it emulates standing in a freezer.</p>
<p><strong>Spares</strong> &#8211; It doesn&#8217;t happen often but you have to prepare for the inevitable breakdown! You&#8217;re going to need some inner-tubes and tyre-levers and also some for air to inflate. You can either have a traditional pump or I used compressed CO2, inflate your tyres at the press of a button. Also, after being stranded with two punctures in one day I would highly recommend having 2x innter-tubes and enough air for both! All these items can go in a saddle bag that clips onto your seat post! Finally, although probably  optional, I would recommend having a multi-tool in case your seat post slips or your handlebars come loose. Unlikely to happen but best to be safe?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it? I think that&#8217;s all you need? Of course there&#8217;s lots more but I think they&#8217;re the basics to start riding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Optional</h2>
<p><strong>Garmin/Bike computer</strong> &#8211; Not only do you know how fast you&#8217;re going, what your average speed is and how high you&#8217;ve climbed, you can also make use of the GPS and add a whole new dimension to your rides!</p>
<p><strong>Arm/leg warmers, skull cap, scarf etc</strong> &#8211; There are tons of little bits and bobs to make your ride much more warmer and ultimately more comfortable. The best thing about these items is that they can be removed if the sun comes out and they don&#8217;t take up much storage room!</p>
<p><strong>Overshoes</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve put these separate as, like my hands, if my feet get cold then I&#8217;ve had it. Alongside my gloves they&#8217;re probably my most important piece of clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Glasses</strong> &#8211; Not only do you look cool but it keeps the sun and pesky insects from your eyes. Nothing worse than shooting downhill and getting a midge in your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Bike camera</strong> &#8211; You can make cycling even more fun when you video your rides. It&#8217;s great to review your ride, especially the climbs you conquered. Also with the increasing number of road accidents it might come in handy if you get knocked off!</p>
<p><strong>Tool box</strong> &#8211; Depending how mechanically minded you are, you might want to have a toolbox so you can fix and tinker with things yourself. However it&#8217;s very common to take your bike to a competent mechanic, they&#8217;re inexpensive and you&#8217;re buying extra piece of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Lubricants/cleaning stuff</strong> &#8211; Very basic maintenance on your drive train and cables is advised to keep your bike in good condition for longer. You will probably want to give your bike a good clean after a muddy ride too.</p>
<p><strong>Lights</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re planning to ride in the dark you will most certainly want lights! Reflective clothing is also advised!</p>
<p><strong>Power/HR meter</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re looking to take cycling serious then these are important tools of the trade. You can utilise the data to enable you to improve your time on the club 10mile!</p>
<p><strong>Chamois cream</strong> &#8211; You might laugh at this one but I certainly didn&#8217;t after my first 50. I didn&#8217;t walk right for a week!</p>
<p><strong>Food/Gels/Water bottles</strong> &#8211; Cycling is a long distance sport, you don&#8217;t normally cycle for 30 mins like you would run on the treadmill at the gym. You get really hungry and thirsty, especially if you&#8217;re digging deep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other stuff might include</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time trail equipment</li>
<li>Baskets/panniers for touring</li>
<li>Set of fast wheels</li>
<li>Indoor training equipment</li>
<li>Spare tyres</li>
<li>Workstand for the bike</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>This is another common question and it&#8217;s a case of how long is a piece of string. It really does depend on what you&#8217;re looking to achieve. That said, you can get a decent level carbon road bike for £1000-£1500. With regards to clothing that&#8217;s also pretty expensive but like the bike, once you&#8217;ve bought it then you&#8217;re sorted for ages. To purchase all the essentials <strong>excluding</strong> the bike might be £300-£500.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a sucker for marketing, branding and overspending so these prices might be a little bit too high. I&#8217;m sure if you look hard enough you will find some great deals! Also if you&#8217;re not too bothered about buying new then you can save a fortune buying second hand!<br />
Thanks for reading!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely buzzing to announce that I will be wearing <a href="http://volero.com.au/" target="_blank">Volero</a> cycling apparel throughout my training and the ride across America. I found Volero through their <a href="http://volero.com.au/" target="_blank">awesome website</a> and they were kind enough to let me sample some of their gear. I was so impressed that I asked if there was any possibility of helping me out with an official kit. They very kindly supplied me with everything I will need over the next year!</p>
<p>Not only is the cycling gear great quality and very comfy, it also looks absolutely fantastic. I can&#8217;t recommend them highly enough.

<p>One thing that has managed to slip through the &#8220;cautious purchases&#8221; net was my new <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/cycling/edge-1000/prod134491.html" target="_blank">Garmin Edge 1000</a>, the King of bike computers. Costing around £300 for the device and an additional £100 for the <a href="http://road.cc/content/review/137336-garmin-edge-1000-performance-bundle" target="_blank">performance bundle</a> (something I needed), it&#8217;s not cheap!</p>
<p>For those of you who have no idea what a Garmin is&#8230;. It&#8217;s used for &#8220;<em>Competing, Connecting and Navigating</em>&#8220;. So it basically has the functionality of a &#8220;sat nav&#8221; but specifically for a bike. In addition, it tells me how fast I&#8217;m going, how high I&#8217;ve climbed, what my heart rate and wattage is and much more stuff that is mostly of interest for excitable cyclists like me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had the Garmin two weeks now and I&#8217;m over the moon with it. I know it&#8217;s a new toy and therefore I&#8217;m going to be excited initially, but it has really sparked some serious life into my rides.</p>
<p>My first real experience with the Garmin was on a glorious Saturday afternoon. I created my route online &#8211; which included dozens of new roads and towns &#8211; and sent it to the device. Not only was it great experiencing the new surroundings, it was also nice to be relieved of navigating duties and being able to focus on my riding. At one point I was heading towards a town that looked familiar so I turned off at the next junction and the Garmin recalculated another route. Nothing ground breaking but I had never experienced this on a bike before.</p>
<p>Since then every ride has been a joy. I simply jump onto my bike and enter some places I have never been before and ride. This is especially useful as my mileage is increasing rapidly and I&#8217;m starting to venture further afield. I&#8217;m planning to bike from <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Cayton,+North+Yorkshire,+UK/Macclesfield+District+General+Hospital,+Victoria+Road,+Macclesfield/@53.747639,-1.8353687,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x487f48422bdab4d5:0xbf6a127a696b670f!2m2!1d-0.382135!2d54.234896!1m5!1m1!1s0x487a49354795fb3b:0xa279386fe95d4700!2m2!1d-2.139448!2d53.262716!3e1?hl=en" target="_blank">Macclesfield back to my hometown Scarborough</a> and the Garmin is going to be perfect for that. Not to mention how invalubale it&#8217;s going to be next year with me covering so many miles in a foreign country. I will pre-program all the routes and not have to worry about getting lost. I guess I could have made do with a map but I don&#8217;t really fancy the hassle!</p>

<p>In addition to the route planning it&#8217;s also great for measuring my performance. There&#8217;s basics such as speed, time and distance, I also can track my heart rate and wattage. Next year I will be aware of my performance levels and will always know from my readings how much I have left in the tank and whether I should speed up or slow down.</p>
<p>The Garmin retails at £400 so it&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.bike-discount.de/en/buy/garmin-edge-1000-navigation-system-209076?currency=3&amp;delivery_country=190&amp;gclid=COOjpvqprsgCFYRz2wodbOQI3g" target="_blank">absolute steal at £285</a>, which is what I paid for it! Bike Discount seems to be the ultimate place to buy bike stuff, no other online shop comes near it for value. Other thoughts about the Garmin:</p>
<ul>
<li>The battery lasts around 10% per hour, so 10 hours max battery life. Will need to charge it in America either via RV on food stops or a portable battery charger in my jersey.</li>
<li>I dimmed the light right down to two bars to conserve battery life.</li>
<li>I fixed the front mount on my bike, looks ace</li>
<li>The heart rate monitor is great, interesting seeing the stats such as HR and cadence. Not purchased a power meter yet (expensive)</li>
<li>The Garmin syncs seamlessly with Strava so my rides are auto-uploaded for the world to see (when it&#8217;s connected to the internet)</li>
<li>The touch screen works through my glove</li>
<li>It&#8217;s waterproof unless I wanted to ride the bottom of the sea</li>
<li>I bought a rubber case for it, cost £8 and offers a bit of protection</li>
<li>It&#8217;s great!</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two months ago I was bike-less.</p>
<p>I had been pondering over dozens of bikes, but waited until I had received work&#8217;s approval before making a purchase (I doubt I would have taken up cycling had it not been for the ride). When the moment finally came I set my heart on buying myself a nice ride that weekend.</p>
<p>I was in two minds whether to go all out and spent a fortune, or purchase a training bike which would see me through winter and inevitably be involved in some kind of fall/crash/bump. I sensibly opted for the latter, deciding that I would get a top quality bike for the actual ride in a years time.</p>
<p>I previously owned a <a href="http://www.evanscycles.com/products/specialized/allez-2015-road-bike-ec070568" target="_blank">Specialised Allez</a> and it served me very well. I did hundreds of miles over multiple years on that workhorse and had very little problems. It was aluminum and felt pretty study, it was a decent entry level bike.</p>
<p>On impulse, I decided to purchase another Allez and set off like a giddy child down to my local Evans Cycles store. Annoyingly they didn&#8217;t have any in stock, they gave me an address for another fully stocked local store and, with closing time approaching, I planned to visit the following day.<br />
I was feeling pretty annoyed, I had hoped to go out riding that afternoon. <strong>However</strong>, all things do happen for a reason in this case, I went back home and curiously started browsing bikes on the internet.</p>
<p>After a few Google searches I ended up on <a href="http://www.argos.co.uk/" target="_blank">Argos website</a> (for those of you non-UK folk it&#8217;s a catalogue shop). I was looking at a carbon road bike for £500, its brand name&#8230;. <em>Ventura, Ace Ventura</em>.</p>
<p>Thinking there had to be some kind of mistake, or that the bike was crap, I investigated a little more. There was barely anything on Google about this brand name and I knew you wouldn&#8217;t normally find a carbon bike less than £1000 in any high street shop (Argos is a high street shop). It was a bit of a mystery until I came across <a href="http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=1&amp;t=1435045&amp;mid=0&amp;nmt=Full+carbon+road+bike+for+400+quid.+What+could+go+wrong%3F" target="_blank">this thread</a>.</p>
<p>Someone had spotted the deal and posted to a cycling forum. Most people were intrigued by the deal and some of them purchased on a whim and gave some very positive feedback. It turns out the bike producers are from Taiwan and use the same frames for bikes such as Mekk &amp; Carrera virago, both of which retail for over £1000 (<a href="http://www.bikeradar.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40042&amp;t=12932562" target="_blank">resource</a>).</p>
<p>I actually purchased mine from a bike dealer on eBay as he was offering the bike fully assembled. He also sorted me with some other cheap essentials when I met the lovely chap. I was on the road with a carbon bike for exactly £600!</p>
<p>I took it out the next day and it was fantastic, nothing will match this carbon bike for value. The gears are Shimano Sora which are the same as the my old Allez, they&#8217;re not amazing but they do the job. The brake padds and saddle I replaced as they had some poor reviews but that was peanuts compared to the savings I made on the bike. It really is light, when I first got on the bike and drove the peddle down it felt like I was going to take off. I&#8217;ve now done over 1000 miles in two months and I&#8217;ve not had any issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>The reason I decided to write this post is because the bike is now on sale for an amazing <strong>£399.99</strong>. I imagine Argos have got a load of these and no one is buying them, but in my opinion they&#8217;re a bit of a hidden gem.</p>
<p>If, like me, you want a decent entry level carbon bike then this &#8220;Ace&#8221; Ventura is your best friend!</p>
<p>You can find it here &#8211; <a href="http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/3324525.htm" target="_blank">http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/3324525.htm</a></p>
