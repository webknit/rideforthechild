				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Xmas I was trying to think of smaller fundraising activities that could raise a few quid, but aren&#8217;t ride related as such. I figured that the best fundraising activities are ones where the donor gets something in return. I spoke to my colleague Jordan Lane about running a small fitness Bootcamp session at my workplace <a href="http://www.steinias.com/">Stein IAS</a>, and we figured it wasn&#8217;t such a bad idea.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-706" src="http://rideforthechild.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bootcamp11.jpg" alt="bootcamp1" width="1201" height="795" srcset="http://rideforthechild.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bootcamp11.jpg 1201w, http://rideforthechild.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bootcamp11-1000x662.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></p>
<p>Most people over-indulge over xmas and January was a perfect time to kick-start the new year and sign up to a 6 week lunchtime Bootcamp. With the help of my assistant &#8211; Sir Lane &#8211; I sent out a few emails, and before we knew it we had 13 people signed up!</p>
<p>Although I had been training for 5 months, I had never in my life taken charge of any fitness class. It was quite daunting and I was extremely nervous on the first session. Myself and Jordan conducted some research into various fitness classes and created our first session, which formed the foundations for the next 6 weeks. It was a mixture of stretching, strength, core and fitness. We planned to start indoor and then move outside once we understood how we could cater for everyone.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-702 size-full" src="http://rideforthechild.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bootcamp1.jpg" alt="bootcamp1" width="1400" height="738" srcset="http://rideforthechild.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bootcamp1.jpg 1400w, http://rideforthechild.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bootcamp1-1000x527.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>The boot-campers were fantastic and I really enjoyed the whole process. Some sessions were really fun and I think people achieved their goals, such as improving their fitness levels or losing a few pounds, there were definite improvements along the way.</p>
<p>Before any money is discussed I would like to say the whole experience made me feel very lucky to work with such great people and for such a supportive company. Never in my 29 years on this earth have I witnessed such a great community in a workplace as I have at <a href="http://www.steinias.com/">Stein IAS</a>.</p>
<p>I am delighted to say we managed to raise an amazing <strong>£286</strong>!!! I am very grateful to everyone who was involved in the sessions and a special thanks to Jordan who was helped me throughout the 6 weeks.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserPage.action?userUrl=rideforthechild&amp;pageUrl=2">The £1600 worth of donations</a> have far exceeded my expectations given that the ride is so far off and that the &#8220;real&#8221; fundraising hasn&#8217;t started yet.</p>
<p>Thanks so much</p>
<p>Shane</p>
<p>You can view videos of the sessions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYb9XlAkPrv1vzG6xVLqniA">here</a>. Here&#8217;s an example session!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely buzzing to announce that I will be wearing <a href="http://volero.com.au/" target="_blank">Volero</a> cycling apparel throughout my training and the ride across America. I found Volero through their <a href="http://volero.com.au/" target="_blank">awesome website</a> and they were kind enough to let me sample some of their gear. I was so impressed that I asked if there was any possibility of helping me out with an official kit. They very kindly supplied me with everything I will need over the next year!</p>
<p>Not only is the cycling gear great quality and very comfy, it also looks absolutely fantastic. I can&#8217;t recommend them highly enough. Here are some photos of my <strong>new awesome kit</strong>, please follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rideforthechild/" target="_blank">instagram</a> for more shots.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to Matt and Joe at Volero!</p>
